The Intake portion of the ticket life cycle is the portion where the client will normally create their ticket. This intake system can normally be email based, but as demostrated in the example the client will have to manually fill out their concern. The clients concern will be manually generated into a ticket for the Help desk to work.

Communucation is very important when it comes to the life cycle of a ticket. As seen in the example you have to get the ticket to the right department or handle it ourselves. You also have to communicate with the client if needed to keep them updated.

Finding a resolution can be difficult in the Ticket Life-cycle at times, but as long as you keep your comunication clear with your team and the client you should be fine.
